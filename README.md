# CASA Support

The [Community App Sharing Architecture (CASA)](http://imsglobal.github.io/casa) provides a mechanism for
discovering and sharing metadata about web resources such as websites, mobile
apps and LTI tools. It models real-world decision-making through extensible
attributes, filter and transform operations, flexible peering relationships,
etc.

This Ruby gem is part of the CASA reference implementation. It provides non-
core support objects.
